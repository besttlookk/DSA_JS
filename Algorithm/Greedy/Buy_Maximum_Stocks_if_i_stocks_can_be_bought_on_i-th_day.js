// !=======================Method 1(Greedy) ====================
// * The idea is to use greedy approach, where we should start buying product from the day when the stock price is least and so on.
// * So, we will sort the pair of two values i.e { stock price, day } according to the stock price, and if stock prices are same, then we sort according to the day.

// * Let say, we have R rs remaining till now, and the cost of product on this day be C, and we can buy atmost L products on this day then,
// * # total purchase on this day (P) = min(L, R/C)
// * Now, add this value to the answer
// * total_purchase = total_purchase + P, where P =min(L, R/C)
// Now, subtract the cost of buying P items from remaining money, R = R â€“ P*C.
// Total number of products that we can buy is equal to total_purchase.

    // * It is not necessary that we would by all the stocks allowed on that particular day.
    // * It may be the case the amout remaining does not allow us. So we take the minimum value
    let costOfStock = pairArr[i][0];
    let totalStockCanBuy = parseInt(remainingAmount / costOfStock); //* but there is limitation
