// !====================Method 1=====================
// * The idea is to create a directed graph of all characters and then find if their is an eulerian circuit in the graph or not.
// * If there is an eulerian circuit, then chain can be formed, otherwise not.
// * Note that a directed graph has eulerian circuit only if in degree and out degree of every vertex is same, and all non-zero degree vertices form a single strongly connected component.

// * Following are detailed steps of the algorithm.
// * 1. Create a directed graph g with number of vertices equal to the size of alphabet.
// * 2. Do following for every string in the given array of strings.
// *  â€¦..a) Add an edge from first character to last character of the given graph.
// * If the created graph has eulerian circuit, then return true, else return false.
