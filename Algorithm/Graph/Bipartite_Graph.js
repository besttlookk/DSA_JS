// !=============Bipartite Graph
// * A Bipartite Graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two independent sets, U and V such that every edge (u, v) either connects a vertex from U to V or a vertex from V to U.
// * In other words, for every edge (u, v), either u belongs to U and v to V, or u belongs to V and v to U. We can also say that there is no edge that connects vertices of same set.

// * A bipartite graph is possible if the graph coloring is possible using two colors such that vertices in a set are colored with the same color.

// * Note that it is possible to color a cycle graph with even cycle using two colors.

// * It is not possible to color a cycle graph with odd cycle using two colors.

// !==================Method 1 (using Breadth First Search (BFS))==================
// * 1. Assign RED color to the source vertex (putting into set U).
// * 2. Color all the neighbors with BLUE color (putting into set V).
// * 3. Color all neighborâ€™s neighbor with RED color (putting into set U).
// * 4. This way, assign color to all vertices such that it satisfies all the constraints of m way coloring problem where m = 2.
// * 5. While assigning colors, if we find a neighbor which is colored with same color as current vertex, then the graph cannot be colored with 2 vertices (or graph is not Bipartite)
