// !=======Tarjanâ€™s Algorithm to find Strongly Connected Components
// * Tarjan Algorithm is based on the following facts:
//*  # DFS search produces a DFS tree/forest
//* #  Strongly Connected Components form subtrees of the DFS tree.
//* # If we can find the head of such subtrees, we can print/store all the nodes in that subtree (including the head) and that will be one SCC.
//* #  There is no back edge from one SCC to another (There can be cross edges, but cross edges will not be used while processing the graph).

// * To find the head of an SCC, we calculate disc and low array (as done for articulation point, bridge, and biconnected component).
// *  low[u] indicates the earliest visited vertex (the vertex with minimum discovery time) that can be reached from a subtree rooted with u. A node u is head if disc[u] = low[u].

// * Disc: This is the time when a node is visited 1st time while DFS traversal.

// * Then later on DFS will be performed on each of its children v one by one, Low value of u can change it in two cases:

// *  # Case1 (Tree Edge): If node v is not visited already, then after the DFS of v is complete, a minimum of low[u] and low[v] will be updated to low[u].
// * low[u] = min(low[u], low[v]);
// *  # Case 2 (Back Edge): When child v is already visited, then a minimum of low[u] and Disc[v] will be updated to low[u].
// * low[u] = min(low[u], disc[v]);
